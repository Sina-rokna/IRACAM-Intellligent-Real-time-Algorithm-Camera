## Overview  
**IRACAM** is a research and development project focused on building an intelligent, real-time distance estimation system using a single monocular camera. It aims to replace costly LiDAR and radar systems by offering a low-cost, efficient, and scalable vision-based solution. The framework integrates computer vision, deep learning, and mathematical modeling to achieve precise distance and time-to-collision estimation for autonomous and driver-assistance systems.

## Technical Summary  
The IRACAM architecture combines object detection, depth estimation, and motion analysis into a unified pipeline optimized for edge AI deployment.  
- **Object Detection:** Implemented with **YOLOv5** for real-time perception.  
- **Depth Estimation:** Developed using **Monodepth2** and analytical geometry.  
- **Optimization:** Accelerated with **TensorRT** and **ONNX Runtime** for high-speed inference.  

This hybrid approach demonstrates that monocular vision can deliver accuracy comparable to multi-sensor setups while significantly reducing cost and computational demand.
